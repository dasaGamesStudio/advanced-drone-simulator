PID tunable Physics based Drone Simulator.


### How this work?

1. In the drone settings menu, you can adjust drone's mass,terminal velocity, motor (thrust/torque/efficency/unequality), and etc for match your drone properties as  in every possible way.

2. After Those settings, now you can give different PID values,ratios to untill drone stablizing and maintain it's desired height.

### For whom?

From a university student to a hobbyist. For anyone who likes to fly drones but does not want to crash them.

### Why is this?

DGS Flight Simulator is designed to create a realistic simulated flight experience for pilots in training and tuning, allowing them to hone their skills without the costs, restrictions and potential risks of real-life training.

## What is the status of development?

It's currently developing. we will update every detail of it soon as possible.
